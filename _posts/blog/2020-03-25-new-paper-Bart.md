In this fMRI paper, we show that dorsal ACC is more strongly connected to face-areas (FFA) in a high-effort versus a low-effort face-relevant task; but more strongly connected to house areas (PPA) in a high-effort versus a low-effort house-relevant task. This finding provides constraints on theories of effort and of ACC.
