Congrats to Kate, Luna, Esther, and Tom with their new paper that just got accepted in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review! :fireworks:
   
In this work they investigated the role of agency in reward prediction error (RPE)-based learning. Earlier research showed that signed RPEs (SRPEs; "better-than-expected" signals) drive declarative learning. However, it is unknown whether this RPE must derive from the participantâ€™s own response, or whether instead, any RPE is sufficient to obtain the learning effect. To test this, RPEs were generated in the same experimental paradigm where an agency and a non-agency condition were combined. In the current paper, no interaction was observed between RPE and agency, suggesting that any RPE (irrespective of its source) can drive declarative learning.
