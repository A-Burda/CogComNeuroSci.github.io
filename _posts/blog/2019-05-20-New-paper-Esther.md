Congrats to Esther Deloof et al. for their new publication in Psychophysiology titled ‘Preparing for hard times: scalp and intracranial physiological signatures of proactive cognitive control’. In this study, it is shown that a cue conveying difficulty information triggers proactive control in absence of motor preparation, and elucidates its neurophysiological signatures. Scalp and iEEG signatures are discussed.
