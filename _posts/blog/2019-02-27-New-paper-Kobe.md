Congrats to Kobe et al. for getting their work accepted in The Journal of Neuroscience.

In their paper, they examine whether neural markers of confidence are predictive of information seeking. To study this, they devised a paradigm in which participants had to make a choice about the average color of eight elements. Before making their final choice, however, participants could decide whether or not they wanted to pay a small cost to see the stimulus again in an easier version. The key result is that neural indices of confidence are functionally involved in information-seeking decisions.
