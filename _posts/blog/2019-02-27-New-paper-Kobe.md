Congrats to Kobe et al. for getting their work accepted in The Journal of Neuroscience.
In their paper, they examine whether neural markers of confidence are predictive of information seeking. To study this, they devised a paradigm in which participants had to make a choice about the average color of eight elements. Before making their final choice, however, participants could decide whether or not they wanted to pay a small cost to see the stimulus again in an easier version.

Using multivariate decoding, the authors then trained a decoder at each point in time to predict based on EEG data whether a trial was judged with high or low confidence. Critically, it was then tested whether this decoder was able to classify whether participants wanted to sample more information or not. This was indeed possible in a time window following the initial speeded response. This time window corresponded to that of a previously established neural marker of confidence (Boldt & Yeung, 2015).

In sum, this study shows that neural indices of confidence are functionally involved in information-seeking decisions.
