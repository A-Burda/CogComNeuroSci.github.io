We adopt a computational approach to investigate the impact of learning and synchronization on both behavioral (reaction time, error rate) and
neural (θ power) measures. We train four models varying in their ability to learn and synchronize for an extended period of time on three seminal
action control paradigms varying in difficulty. Learning, but not synchronization, proved essential for behavioral improvement. Synchronization
however boosts performance of difficult tasks, avoiding the computational pitfalls of catastrophic interference. At the neural level, θ power
decreases with practice but increases with task difficulty.
