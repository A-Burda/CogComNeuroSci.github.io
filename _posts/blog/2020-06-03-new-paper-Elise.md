Congrats to Elise, Cris, et al., for collaboration in this multi-lab fMRI study. Several groups studied the same experimental questions via fMRI. On some questions there was consensus across labs, but on others not. A meta-analysis across labs investigated which factors determine (statistical) significance of a result.
