Our own Pieter Huycke has won the first Mensenkennis Trofee, for his article on the ideal pricing of a product.   
This award was created in order to stimulate students to communicate the results of their research to a general audience.

You can read the article (written in Dutch) [here](https://www.knack.be/nieuws/wetenschap/goede-waar-prijst-zichzelf-niet/article-opinion-1378179.html).   

Congrats Pieter!
