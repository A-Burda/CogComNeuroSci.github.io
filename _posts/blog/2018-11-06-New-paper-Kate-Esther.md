Congrats to Kate, Esther, Clio and Tom with their new paper that just got accepted in NeuroImage! :fireworks:
   
In this work, they investigated the time course of neural oscillations in processing reward during declarative learning.   
Earlier research showed that signed reward prediction errors (SRPE’s; “better-than-expected” signals) drive declarative learning. In the current paper, the occurrence of reward prediction errors (RPEs) was further validated by oscillatory signatures in the theta, high-beta and high-alpha bands.
