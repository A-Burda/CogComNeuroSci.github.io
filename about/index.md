__Personal statement__   
Humans are biological beings. Thus, behavior is generally adaptive, meaning that it aims to optimise some goal function (e.g., to minimise error or to maximise reward). At the same time, humans live in rapidly changing environments, so this ideal will often not be reached.

From this perspective, human behavior is often not optimal, but humans learn to gradually achieve their goal (function). In summary, humans learn adaptive behavior, and this defines the topic of our research group.

Although this is a fairly broad topic, there are a few recurring themes, such as learning to use inter-areal synchrony for neural communication; learning what to store in declarative memory; and learning the (meta-)parameters of decision processes. For this research, we use behavioral, computational, and neural methods.

I am interested in neurocognitive and neuromodulatory mechanisms of attention and decision-making under uncertainty. 
In the current project, I explore how Bayesian estimates about uncertainty guide attention using computational modelling in combination with electroencephalography and pupillometry. 

My research is supported by an FWO (Research Foundation – Flanders) post-doctoral fellowship.

# Cristian Buc Calderon

My research focuses on understanding how humans select one out of many competing actions. My past research tested specific predictions of the affordance competition hypothesis (Cisek & Kalaska, 2010, Ann. Rev. Neurosci.), both at the neural architecture and decision dynamics levels ([Calderon et al., 2015, JEPG](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/6907785/file/7276986); [Calderon et al., 2017, PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/40/10618.full.pdf); [Calderon et al., 2018, Front. Hum. Neurosci.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00093/full); [Calderon et al., 2018, Psychol. Rev.](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8577798/file/8577801)). 

More recently, I have been awarded a FWO postdoctoral fellow where I will investigate how the brain learns the optimal timing of individual actions within a sequence of actions (in collaboration with Michael Frank @ Brown University and Tom Verguts @ Ghent University). To carry out this project, I use computational modeling, behavioral and neural methods. 

PS: I took the picture of Pieter Verbeke (scroll down ;)).

# Elise Lesage

My current project studies how behavior becomes habitual and how habits can be overcome. I use computational modeling, fMRI, and brain stimulation techniques to investigate these questions.

My broader research interests are pretty varied and can be described as: finding out how humans think :). Before and during my PhD I studied the role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions such as language and cognition. In my postdoc at NIDA (NIH) I switched gears and learned more about addiction and reward processing. My present Fellowship integrates some of the key ideas behind reward processing, automaticity, and cognition.

My Fellowship is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) and the European Commission’s Marie Curie Actions through the Pegasus scheme.

Our brains are simultaneously tasked with acting in the present while predicting and preparing for the future. I am interested in how we proactively optimize neural systems ahead of future goal-directed action. In one ongoing line of work, I use EEG/MEG to investigate the neural activities underlying the computation, communication, and maintenance of future goals. In my current work, I focus on how errors in reward prediction shape learning, using computational modeling and MEG/EEG. In particular, I aim to understand how reward prediction (error) is influenced by timing and hierarchical context. My current research is supported by the EOS project MEMODYN, funded by the FWO and F.R.S.–FNRS.

# Kobe Desender

<img src="/images/profile_pic_kobe.jpg" alt="Kobe Desender" width="33%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">

In my research, I focus on the question how metacognition is used for further adaptation of behavior. Currently, I examine how subjective confidence in a decision is used to further optimize cognition. Theoretical models of confidence posit an important role for confidence in learning and adapting behavior, and these are the dynamics that I wish to unravel. I combine behavioral measures, computational modeling, and electrophysiological recordings to answer these questions. In previous work performed during my PhD at the VUB (Belgium), I used behavioral and EEG recordings to unravel the relation between metacognition and conflict processing. I am supported by an FWO {PEGASUS} Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship.

# Mehdi Senoussi

My research currently focuses on top-down/cognitive control mechanisms that allow us to manipulate and use perceptual and/or mnesic representations. For instance our ability implement a task rule (bind a percept to a motor command), attend to a specific feature, switch between sensory modalities or create and manipulate a mental image. I use Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and modeling methods to better understand which and when relevant representations emerge in neural activity. And to know how (and when) such representations are bound together (e.g. perceptual <-> task representations) I use connectivity measures (phase-locking, cross-frequency coupling). In previous work during my PhD at the CerCo lab (Toulouse) I used fMRI, EEG and MVPA to measure the effects of learning on neural representations of visual objects and how it affects perception.

My research focuses on how reward and reward prediction errors (i.e., mismatches between reward outcome and reward expectation) influence declarative memory (e.g., learning a foreign language). Using a Dutch-Swahili word learning paradigm, we found that word pair recognition increases linearly with larger and more positive RPEs [(De Loof et al., 2018)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189212). We also found neural oscillatory signatures that confirm the experience of signed RPEs (SRPEs) boosting declarative memory [(Ergo et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320676). My goal is to further investigate the robustness and generality of these findings. To this end, I use both behavioral and (electro)physiological (i.e., EEG, tACS and eye tracking) measures. My PhD is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO).

Outside of the lab, I enjoy travelling, gaming, playing the guitar and singing.

In my Ph.D. project, we aim to take a fresh perspective that emphasizes the study of memory, in its natural dynamic setting, as a journey in the making. The two key characters in this journey are learning and consolidation: both processes are known to interact but have hitherto been studied in isolation. The perspective of this project enables them to be understood, for the first time, under the influence of their inherent interactions, and in the context of brain maturation and aging. The project aims to provide new insight into how much our ability to learn is dictated by the makeup of our neuronal circuitries, how memories are initially formed and later stored for the long haul, how this is made possible by the rewiring of our neuronal circuitries, and how our memory processes and capacities vary as our brain evolves through its lifespan. 

For this project I use mainly EEG and computational modeling. I like to perform my EEG analyses using Python's [mne software](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html). Computational modeling is something I try to achieve using Python 3. 

Outside my work I find joy in programming, mainly to solve mathematical riddles. Also, I like to learn more about the Python programming language in general. Code for my first and second passion can both be found on my personal GitHub.

Psychologists tend to be interested not only in understanding, but also in improving, human cognition and behaviour. Correspondingly, it has already been extensively demonstrated that concrete behaviours can indeed be modulated by selectively rewarding certain behaviours more than others. Inspired by computational models of cognitive control, I investigate whether, in the same way, it is also possible to modulate abstract task execution parameters, such as learning rate, as described by computational models of learning and decision making. Moreover, I investigate whether these parameters can be adapted to multiple environments (in terms of reward contingencies) simultaneously, guided by associated contextual features.

I conduct this research in collaboration with Tom Verguts and Senne Braem, using a combination of computational modelling, behavioural and neuroimaging techniques.

Previous studies of human cognition at different time scales have reported two mechanisms to alter connectivity between brain regions. First, the brain can adjust the strength of the synaptic connections between different neurons. Second, regions can be bound together by synchronizing their oscillations (Fries, 2005). In this PhD project, we investigate how interactions between these two dynamics lead to the remarkable flexibility (and also stability) in human behavior. Additionally, we investigate how the brain is able to know which regions to synchronize by exerting learning at a higher hierarchical level. For these purposes, we aim at describing computational models and test these models empirically with EEG.
