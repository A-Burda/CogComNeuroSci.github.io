__Personal statement__   
Humans are biological beings. Thus, behavior is generally adaptive, meaning it aims toward optimising some goal function (e.g., to minimise error or to maximise reward). At the same time, humans live in rapidly changing environments, so this ideal will often not be reached.

From this perspective, human behavior is often not optimal, but humans learn to gradually achieve their goal (function). In summary, humans learn adaptive behavior, and this defines the topic of our research group.

Although this is a fairly broad topic, there are a few recurring themes, such as reinforcement learning, the use of neural synchrony for neural communication, and the role of confidence in performance adaptation. For this research, we use behavioral, computational, and neural methods.

# Cristian Buc Calderon

My research focuses on understanding how humans select one out of many competing actions. My past research tested specific predictions of the affordance competition hypothesis (Cisek & Kalaska, 2010, Ann. Rev. Neurosci.), both at the neural architecture and decision dynamics levels (Calderon et al., 2015, JEPG; Calderon et al., 2017, PNAS; Calderon et al., 2018, Front. Hum. Neurosci.; Calderon et al., 2018, Psychol. Rev.). 

More recently, I have been awarded a FWO postdoctoral fellow where I will investigate how the brain learns the optimal timing of individual actions within a sequence of actions (in collaboration with Michael Frank @ Brown University and Tom Verguts @ Ghent University). To carry out this project, I use computational modeling, behavioral and neural methods. 

PS: I took the picture of Pieter Verbeke (scroll down ;)).

# Elise Lesage

My current project studies how behavior becomes habitual and how habits can be overcome. I use computational modeling, fMRI, and brain stimulation techniques to investigate these questions.

My broader research interests are pretty varied and can be described as: finding out how humans think :). Before and during my PhD I studied the role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions such as language and cognition. In my postdoc at NIDA (NIH) I switched gears and learned more about addiction and reward processing. My present Fellowship integrates some of the key ideas behind reward processing, automaticity, and cognition.

My Fellowship is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) and the European Commission’s Marie Curie Actions through the Pegasus scheme.

In my research, I focus on the question how metacognition is used for further adaptation of behavior. Currently, I examine how subjective confidence in a decision is used to further optimize cognition. Theoretical models of confidence posit an important role for confidence in learning and adapting behavior, and these are the dynamics that I wish to unravel. I combine behavioral measures, computational modeling, and electrophysiological recordings to answer these questions. In previous work performed during my PhD at the VUB (Belgium), I used behavioral and EEG recordings to unravel the relation between metacognition and conflict processing. I am supported by an FWO {PEGASUS} Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship.

My research currently focuses on top-down/cognitive control mechanisms that allow us to manipulate and use perceptual and/or mnesic representations. For instance our ability implement a task rule (bind a percept to a motor command), attend to a specific feature, switch between sensory modalities or create and manipulate a mental image. I use Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and modeling methods to better understand which and when relevant representations emerge in neural activity. And to know how (and when) such representations are bound together (e.g. perceptual <-> task representations) I use connectivity measures (phase-locking, cross-frequency coupling). In previous work during my PhD at the CerCo lab (Toulouse) I used fMRI, EEG and MVPA to measure the effects of learning on neural representations of visual objects and how it affects perception.

My research focuses on how reward and reward prediction errors (i.e., mismatches between reward outcome and reward expectation) influence declarative memory (e.g., learning a foreign language). Using a Dutch-Swahili word learning paradigm, we found that word pair recognition increases linearly with larger and more positive RPEs [(De Loof et al., 2018)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189212). We also found neural oscillatory signatures that confirm the experience of signed RPEs (SRPEs) boosting declarative memory [(Ergo et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320676). My goal is to further investigate the robustness and generality of these findings. To study how RPEs influence declarative memory, I use both behavioral and EEG studies. Recently, I also became interested in neurostimulation techniques, such as tACS. My PhD is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO).

Outside of the lab, I enjoy hanging out with my dog Fellow, playing the guitar, karaoke, gaming and travelling.

In my Ph.D. project, we aim to take a fresh perspective that emphasizes the study of memory, in its natural dynamic setting, as a journey in the making. The two key characters in this journey are learning and consolidation: both processes are known to interact but have hitherto been studied in isolation. The perspective of this project enables them to be understood, for the first time, under the influence of their inherent interactions, and in the context of brain maturation and aging. The project aims to provide new insight into how much our ability to learn is dictated by the makeup of our neuronal circuitries, how memories are initially formed and later stored for the long haul, how this is made possible by the rewiring of our neuronal circuitries, and how our memory processes and capacities vary as our brain evolves through its lifespan. 

For this project I use mainly EEG and computational modeling. I like to perform my EEG analyses using Python's [mne software](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html). Computational modeling is something I try to achieve using Python 3. 

Outside my work I find joy in programming, mainly to solve mathematical riddles. Also, I like to learn more about the Python programming language in general. Code for my first and second passion can both be found on my personal GitHub.

Previous studies of human cognition at different time scales have reported two mechanisms to alter connectivity between brain regions. First, the brain can adjust the strength of the synaptic connections between different neurons. Second, regions can be bound together by synchronizing their oscillations (Fries, 2005). In this PhD project, we investigate how interactions between these two dynamics lead to the remarkable flexibility (and also stability) in human behavior. Additionally, we investigate how the brain is able to know which regions to synchronize by exerting learning at a higher hierarchical level. For these purposes, we aim at describing computational models and test these models empirically with EEG.

I am currently in the final stages of my DPhil at Oxford University in the Summerfield lab. My work focuses on how information is structured and transformed in the brain during decision making, mainly using neurophysiological measures (EEG) and computational modelling. One line of research has looked at how structure (e.g. a line, circle, hierarchy, ...) is represented in the brain. For example we studied whether decisions about different categories with a shared underlying structure rely on the same neural signals [(Luyckx et al., eLife, 2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/42816). A different line of research has focused on the neural mechanisms of value-based decision making, specifically how neural patterns can shed a light on why we make economically "irrational" choices [(Luyckx et al., bioRxiv, 2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/642371v3).  

Outside of work, I like to torment the strings on my guitar or squash racket.
