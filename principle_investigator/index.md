__Personal statement__   
With some effort, most people can find their way in a new city. But how they do that, remains something of a mystery. Presumably, earlier knowledge (consulting maps, asking strangers, quickly storing a spatial path, etc) is recombined in novel ways to get to your destination. In this sense, we can call this a partially novel task. The ability to perform such tasks is called cognitive control. 

My main interest is understanding the mechanisms of cognitive control, using behavioral, computational, and neural methods.
